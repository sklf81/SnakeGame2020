# SnakeGame2020
This is the Repos for creating a small handheld Snake-Game based on the ATMEGA 328p.

## Software
You can find the source code for this project in /software. This includes the .iso file for programming the ATMEGA 328p and a library.
The library is the code for the mechanics of this game. I created this libraray, so I can seperate all the hardware-near stuff (.iso) and the basic program for the game itself (library).

## Schematics
In /schematics is a pdf of the circuit diagram. Obviously you have to connect the ATMEGA 328p in a certain way with other components for the game to work and the schematic pdf shows you how!

## PCB-Layout
in /pcb_layout are pictures of the PCB and the gerber files of the PCB. You can manufacture a PCB with the Gerber-Files if you want to.
